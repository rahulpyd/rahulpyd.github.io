                <p>Our experience tells a story about learning. That we learn a lot more by doing than just learning from books. During my undergrad years I was advised by a prof who is a very good mathematician. He advised me to question about that correctness of everything -- everything that we hear and read. As questions like -- why does that book or author say something is true and something is false? It is a timeless peice of advice. However, sometimes it is  easy to overlook the advice all together and sometime we  may not be asking the right questions. This is the major limitation of passive  learning. </p>
<p>Things change when we learn by doing. We are forced to ask questions and find answers as we build things as opposed to learning from books or lectures. Building things sets a well defined learning outcomes and truly tests what we are learning. Learning by doing exposes the limits of our knowledge or the illusion of knowlege. Does it is apply to theoretical subjects like mathematics? I guess we can do a lot better when we seek to solve real-world applications of theoretical subjects. </p>
